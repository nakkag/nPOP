nPOP Ver 1.2.5
--

[Introduction]

This software allows you to access e-mail on a POP3 mail server on your PC. It provides the
function of common remote e-mail access.

The mail displayed by nPOP is only the mail on the present on the server. Therefore, if mail
is deleted from your server it will disappear from a list, even if the mail is displayed in
the list.

When you connect using nPOP, the mail is listed and you can see the header only.  From that
list you can select e-mail you want to receive on your PC. This is more efficient than
downloading all the e-mail on your PC.

It can be use for management of the mail on a server etc. as a method to check for the arrival
of new e-mail.
